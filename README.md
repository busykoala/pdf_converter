# Busykoala PDF Converter

## Study Project

This project is a study project for me to get to know python better.

## Goal

The package shall convert as much fileformats to pdf as it's possible in the
scope of this project.

## Quickstart

Clone and install package:

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:busykoala/pdf_converter.git

cd pdf_converter

path/to/python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

python setup.py install
```

Until now the package can do nothing.  
Therefore here are no commands to do stuff...

## Usage

This package is no good. Don't use it in any way yet ;)
